I am a recent Compute Science graduate student from Arizona State University.
Currently, I am exploring the field of Music Information Retrieval, focused on playlist representation and recommendation.
This blog is my journal as I explore the mystical world of binary and try to create something meaningful.

When not wrangling with the 1s and 0s, I’m likely reading blogs, running or playing guitar.
